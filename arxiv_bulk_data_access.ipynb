       " \"in smart grid, the utility provider (up) collects users power measurements' for two main reasons: billing and operation. billing needs coarse-grained measurements where there are no, or minimal, privacy concerns. on the other hand, operation needs fine-grained measurements which can highly affect users' privacy. hence, users might be reluctant to participate in operational metering to protect their privacy. to overcome this issue, up might offer rewards to allure users to report their measurements which endangers their privacy. in this paper, we survey the literature on privacy-preserving metering in smart grid. we propose a new taxonomy to categorize the literature based on whether measurements need to be attributable to users or not. this categorization is highly effective because attribution is one of the main causes of privacy issues. our survey shows that rewarding schemes and incentive-based demand response are new research topics with limited studies on it. hence, we propose two privacy-preserving rewarding schemes for operational metering. first, a light-weight solution that utilizes an already established link of trust i.e. banks. it is based on the assumption that banks will not leak a client account details. this solution is based on hash chains and blind signatures to assure users anonymity with minimal overhead for the up and the smart meter. the bank in this approach is state-less in which is not required the bank to keep communications states of users and the up. second, we proposed another approach that does not rely on or banks or trusted third parties. it is based on paillier homomorphic encryption and pedersen commitments. it assumes that the smart meters are organized in a tree structure; which is widely used implementation in the literature. security analysis for the proposed approaches is presented including unlinkability proof for measurements to users.\",\n",

       " 'anonymous communication networks are important building blocks for online privacy protection. one approach to achieve anonymity is to relay messages through multiple routers, where each router shuffles messages independently. to achieve anonymity, at least one router needs to be honest. in the presence of an adversary that is controlling a subset of the routers unbiased routing is important for guaranteeing anonymity. however, the routing strategy also influenced other factors such as the scalability and the performance of the system. one solution is to use a fixed route for relaying all messages with many routers. if the route is not fixed the routing decision can either be made by the communication initiator or the intermediate routers. however, the existing routing types each have limitations. for example, one faces scalability issues when increasing the throughput of systems with fixed routes. moreover, when the routing decision is left to the initiator, the initiator needs to maintain an up-to-date view of the system at all times, which also does not scale. if the routing decision is left to intermediate routers the routing of the communication can be influenced by an adversary. in this work, we propose a novel multiparty routing approach for anonymous communication that addresses these shortcomings. we distribute the routing decision and verify the correctness of routing to achieve routing integrity. more concretely, we provide a mixnet design that uses our routing approach and that in addition, addresses load balancing. we show that our system is secure against a global active adversary.',\n",

       " 'in many supervised learning tasks, the entities to be labeled are related to each other in complex ways and their labels are not independent. for example, in hypertext classification, the labels of linked pages are highly correlated. a standard approach is to classify each entity independently, ignoring the correlations between them. recently, probabilistic relational models, a relational version of bayesian networks, were used to define a joint probabilistic model for a collection of related entities. in this paper, we present an alternative framework that builds on (conditional) markov networks and addresses two limitations of the previous approach. first, undirected models do not impose the acyclicity constraint that hinders representation of many important relational dependencies in directed models. second, undirected models are well suited for discriminative training, where we optimize the conditional likelihood of the labels given the features, which generally improves classification accuracy. we show how to train these models effectively, and how to use approximate probabilistic inference over the learned model for collective classification of multiple related entities. we provide experimental results on a webpage classification task, showing that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies.',\n",
       " 'concuroram is a parallel, multi-client oblivious ram (oram) that eliminates waiting for concurrent stateless clients and allows overall throughput to scale gracefully, without requiring trusted third party components (proxies) or direct inter-client coordination. a key insight behind concuroram is the fact that, during multi-client data access, only a subset of the concurrently-accessed server-hosted data structures require access privacy guarantees. everything else can be safely implemented as oblivious data structures that are later synced securely and efficiently during an oram \"eviction\". further, since a major contributor to latency is the eviction - in which client-resident data is reshuffled and reinserted back encrypted into the main server database - concuroram also enables multiple concurrent clients to evict asynchronously, in parallel (without compromising consistency), and in the background without having to block ongoing queries. as a result, throughput scales well with increasing number of concurrent clients and is not significantly impacted by evictions. for example, about 65 queries per second can be executed in parallel by 30 concurrent clients, a 2x speedup over the state-of-the-art. the query access time for individual clients increases by only 2x when compared to a single-client deployment.',\n",

       " \"a new approach to data compression is developed and applied to multimedia content. this method separates messages into components suitable for both lossless coding and 'lossy' or statistical coding techniques, compressing complex objects by separately encoding signals and noise. this is demonstrated by compressing the most significant bits of data exactly, since they are typically redundant and compressible, and either fitting a maximally likely noise function to the residual bits or compressing them using lossy methods. upon decompression, the significant bits are decoded and added to a noise function, whether sampled from a noise model or decompressed from a lossy code. this results in compressed data similar to the original. for many test images, a two-part image code using jpeg2000 for lossy coding and paq8l for lossless coding produces less mean-squared error than an equal length of jpeg2000. computer-generated images typically compress better using this method than through direct lossy coding, as do many black and white photographs and most color photographs at sufficiently high quality levels. examples applying the method to audio and video coding are also demonstrated. since two-part codes are efficient for both periodic and chaotic data, concatenations of roughly similar objects may be encoded efficiently, which leads to improved inference. applications to artificial intelligence are demonstrated, showing that signals using an economical lossless code have a critical level of redundancy which leads to better description-based inference than signals which encode either insufficient data or too much detail.\",\n",

       " 'a common problem in risk analysis is to characterize the overall security of a system of valuable assets (e.g., government buildings or communication hubs), and to suggest measures to mitigate any hazards or security threats. currently, analysts typically rely on a combination of indices, such as resilience, robustness, redundancy, security, and vulnerability. however, these indices are not by themselves sufficient as a guide to action; for example, while it is possible to develop policies to decrease vulnerability, such policies may not always be cost-effective. motivated by this gap, we propose a new index, defensibility. a system is considered defensible to the extent that a modest investment can significantly reduce the damage from an attack or disruption. to compare systems whose performance is not readily commensurable (e.g., the electrical grid vs. the water-distribution network, both of which are critical, but which provide distinct types of services), we defined defensibility as a dimensionless index. after defining defensibility quantitatively, we illustrate how the defensibility of a system depends on factors such as the defender and attacker asset valuations, the nature of the threat (whether intelligent and adaptive, or random), and the levels of attack and defense strengths and provide analytical results that support the observations arising from the above illustrations. overall, we argue that the defensibility of a system is an important dimension to consider when evaluating potential defensive investments, and that it can be applied in a variety of different contexts.',\n",

       " \"in representation learning and non-linear dimension reduction, there is a huge interest to learn the 'disentangled' latent variables, where each sub-coordinate almost uniquely controls a facet of the observed data. while many regularization approaches have been proposed on variational autoencoders, heuristic tuning is required to balance between disentanglement and loss in reconstruction accuracy -- due to the unsupervised nature, there is no principled way to find an optimal weight for regularization. motivated to completely bypass regularization, we consider a projection strategy: modifying the canonical gaussian encoder, we add a layer of scaling and rotation to the gaussian mean, such that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates become exactly zero. this achieves a theoretically maximal disentanglement, as guaranteed by zero cross-correlation between one latent sub-coordinate and the observed varying with the rest. unlike regularizations, the extra projection layer does not impact the flexibility of the previous encoder layers, leading to almost no loss in expressiveness. this approach is simple to implement in practice. our numerical experiments demonstrate very good performance, with no tuning required.\",\n",
       " \"starting from the one-way group action framework of brassard and yung (crypto '90), we revisit building cryptography based on group actions. several previous candidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on classical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g., discrete logarithm).   we propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to build cryptography based on group actions. recent works (futorny--grochow--sergeichuk, lin. alg. appl., 2019) suggest that the underlying algorithmic problem, the tensor isomorphism problem, is the hardest one among several isomorphism testing problems arising from areas including coding theory, computational group theory, and multivariate cryptography. we present evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive study of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, and hardness results, as well as quantum algorithms.   we then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further develop group-action based cryptography. briefly speaking, given a group $g$ acting on a set $s$, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions of $(s, t)$ either uniformly chosen from $s\\\\times s$, or where $s$ is randomly chosen from $s$ and $t$ is the result of applying a random group action of $g\\\\in g$ on $s$. this subsumes the classical decisional diffie-hellman assumption when specialized to a particular group action. we carefully analyze various attack strategies that support the general linear group action on tensors as a candidate for this assumption.   finally, we establish the quantum security of several cryptographic primitives based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom group action assumption.\",\n",

       " \"we analyze the multivariate generalization of howgrave-graham's algorithm for the approximate common divisor problem. in the m-variable case with modulus n and approximate common divisor of size n^beta, this improves the size of the error tolerated from n^(beta^2) to n^(beta^((m+1)/m)), under a commonly used heuristic assumption. this gives a more detailed analysis of the hardness assumption underlying the recent fully homomorphic cryptosystem of van dijk, gentry, halevi, and vaikuntanathan. while these results do not challenge the suggested parameters, a 2^(n^epsilon) approximation algorithm with epsilon<2/3 for lattice basis reduction in n dimensions could be used to break these parameters. we have implemented our algorithm, and it performs better in practice than the theoretical analysis suggests.   our results fit into a broader context of analogies between cryptanalysis and coding theory. the multivariate approximate common divisor problem is the number-theoretic analogue of multivariate polynomial reconstruction, and we develop a corresponding lattice-based algorithm for the latter problem. in particular, it specializes to a lattice-based list decoding algorithm for parvaresh-vardy and guruswami-rudra codes, which are multivariate extensions of reed-solomon codes. this yields a new proof of the list decoding radii for these codes.\",\n",
       " '3d convolutional neural networks are sensitive to transformations applied to their input. this is a problem because a voxelized version of a 3d object, and its rotated clone, will look unrelated to each other after passing through to the last layer of a network. instead, an idealized model would preserve a meaningful representation of the voxelized object, while explaining the pose-difference between the two inputs. an equivariant representation vector has two components: the invariant identity part, and a discernable encoding of the transformation. models that can\\'t explain pose-differences risk \"diluting\" the representation, in pursuit of optimizing a classification or regression loss function.   we introduce a group convolutional neural network with linear equivariance to translations and right angle rotations in three dimensions. we call this network cubenet, reflecting its cube-like symmetry. by construction, this network helps preserve a 3d shape\\'s global and local signature, as it is transformed through successive layers. we apply this network to a variety of 3d inference problems, achieving state-of-the-art on the modelnet10 classification challenge, and comparable performance on the isbi 2012 connectome segmentation benchmark. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3d rotation equivariant cnn for voxel representations.',\n",

       " 'multiclass prediction is the problem of classifying an object into a relevant target class. we consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sub-linearly with the number of possible classes. this implies that features should be shared by several classes. we describe and analyze the shareboost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. we prove that shareboost efficiently finds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. we also describe how to use shareboost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. in a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the benefits of shareboost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches.',\n",
       " 'embedded, continual learning for autonomous and adaptive behavior is a key application of neuromorphic hardware. however, neuromorphic implementations of embedded learning at large scales that are both flexible and efficient have been hindered by a lack of a suitable algorithmic framework. as a result, the most neuromorphic hardware is trained off-line on large clusters of dedicated processors or gpus and transferred post hoc to the device. we address this by introducing the neural and synaptic array transceiver (nsat), a neuromorphic computational framework facilitating flexible and efficient embedded learning by matching algorithmic requirements and neural and synaptic dynamics. nsat supports event-driven supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms including deep learning. we demonstrate the nsat in a wide range of tasks, including the simulation of mihalas-niebur neuron, dynamic neural fields, event-driven random back-propagation for event-based deep learning, event-based contrastive divergence for unsupervised learning, and voltage-based learning rules for sequence learning. we anticipate that this contribution will establish the foundation for a new generation of devices enabling adaptive mobile systems, wearable devices, and robots with data-driven autonomy.',\n",
       " 'we propose a model of interdependent scheduling games in which each player controls a set of services that they schedule independently. a player is free to schedule his own services at any time; however, each of these services only begins to accrue reward for the player when all predecessor services, which may or may not be controlled by the same player, have been activated. this model, where players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced in planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring electricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical care in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of staff, equipment, and medicine. we undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this setting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization, computing best responses, nash dynamics, and existence and computation of nash equilibria.',\n",

       " \"we design mechanisms for online procurement of data held by strategic agents for machine learning tasks. the challenge is to use past data to actively price future data and give learning guarantees even when an agent's cost for revealing her data may depend arbitrarily on the data itself. we achieve this goal by showing how to convert a large class of no-regret algorithms into online posted-price and learning mechanisms. our results in a sense parallel classic sample complexity guarantees, but with the key resource being money rather than quantity of data: with a budget constraint $b$, we give robust risk (predictive error) bounds on the order of $1/\\\\sqrt{b}$. because we use an active approach, we can often guarantee to do significantly better by leveraging correlations between costs and data.   our algorithms and analysis go through a model of no-regret learning with $t$ arriving pairs (cost, data) and a budget constraint of $b$. our regret bounds for this model are on the order of $t/\\\\sqrt{b}$ and we give lower bounds on the same order.\",\n",
       " 'program translation is an important tool to migrate legacy code in one language into an ecosystem built in a different language. in this work, we are the first to employ deep neural networks toward tackling this problem. we observe that program translation is a modular procedure, in which a sub-tree of the source tree is translated into the corresponding target sub-tree at each step. to capture this intuition, we design a tree-to-tree neural network to translate a source tree into a target one. meanwhile, we develop an attention mechanism for the tree-to-tree model, so that when the decoder expands one non-terminal in the target tree, the attention mechanism locates the corresponding sub-tree in the source tree to guide the expansion of the decoder. we evaluate the program translation capability of our tree-to-tree model against several state-of-the-art approaches. compared against other neural translation models, we observe that our approach is consistently better than the baselines with a margin of up to 15 points. further, our approach can improve the previous state-of-the-art program translation approaches by a margin of 20 points on the translation of real-world projects.',\n",
       " 'generative policy-based models aim to enable a coalition of systems, be they devices or services to adapt according to contextual changes such as environmental factors, user preferences and different tasks whilst adhering to various constraints and regulations as directed by a managing party or the collective vision of the coalition. recent developments have proposed new architectures to realize the potential of gpms but as the complexity of systems and their associated requirements increases, there is an emerging requirement to have scenarios and associated datasets to realistically evaluate gpms with respect to the properties of the operating environment, be it the future battlespace or an autonomous organization. in order to address this requirement, in this paper, we present a method of applying an agile knowledge representation framework to model requirements, both individualistic and collective that enables synthetic generation of ground truth data such that advanced gpms can be evaluated robustly in complex environments. we also release conceptual models, annotated datasets, as well as means to extend the data generation approach so that similar datasets can be developed for varying complexities and different situations.',\n",
       " 'despite their near dominance, heuristic state search planners still lag behind disjunctive planners in the generation of parallel plans in classical planning. the reason is that directly searching for parallel solutions in state space planners would require the planners to branch on all possible subsets of parallel actions, thus increasing the branching factor exponentially. we present a variant of our heuristic state search planner altalt, called altaltp which generates parallel plans by using greedy online parallelization of partial plans. the greedy approach is significantly informed by the use of novel distance heuristics that altaltp derives from a graphplan-style planning graph for the problem. while this approach is not guaranteed to provide optimal parallel plans, empirical results show that altaltp is capable of generating good quality parallel plans at a fraction of the cost incurred by the disjunctive planners.',\n",
